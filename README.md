# mazesolver
Program takes in an input file maze that consists of the dimensions of the maze, and the 
maze itself which contains walls marked by '#' and an ending location marked with 'E'. It
then recursively finds the end of the maze by checking all possibilities from the starting point.

The path is marked with directional arrows, while a "." resembles a deadend spot that has been checked but does not lead anywhere.
